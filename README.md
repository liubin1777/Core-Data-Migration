Core-Data-Migration
===================

Project, showing all three ways of Migration: Lightweight Migration, Mapping Model and Manual Migration

In this i created 3 different migration examples, each on separate branch:
 - lightweight migration, where one attribute is added and one renamed
 - mapping model migration, where Publisher Entity is splitted into Person and Company, based on number of ads they have.
 - manual migration, where custom policy is used to add a default Country(Russia) Entity relationship to all the existing adds.
 - master branch with the base model
